# Git Workflow Simulation
For managing product releases that need to happen on the 25th of every month, a structured Git Workflow can help maintain a smooth development, testing, and release process. Below is a Git Workflow Architecture that you can implement:

# Git Workflow Architecture:
**Main Branch** (Production)
This branch should always be stable and contain code that has been tested and is ready for production.
The product release on the 25th of every month will be made from this branch.

**Develop Branch**
The branch where the integration of new features and bug fixes happens.
Regular updates are merged into the develop branch from feature branches.
It serves as a base for testing and QA.

**Feature Branches** (Feature/xyz)
Each new feature or bug fix gets its own branch, created off the develop branch.
Once completed and tested locally, they are merged back into the develop branch.

**Release Branches** (Release/v1.x.x)
Before the 25th of the month, a release branch is created from develop. This branch will be used for final testing, bug fixing, and preparing for deployment.
No new features should be added to this branch, only fixes and final preparations for the release.

**Hotfix Branches** (Hotfix/xyz)
For emergency bug fixes that need to be applied directly to the main branch. After applying a fix, it should also be merged back into develop and the relevant release branch (if it exists).

**Version Tags**
Each release on the 25th should be tagged with a version number (e.g., v1.0.0) for easy reference and rollback if needed.

# Example Workflow:

Developers work on feature/xyz branches.
Completed features are merged into the develop branch.
On the 15th of the month, create a release branch (release/v1.x.x) from develop.
Perform final testing, bug fixes, and documentation updates on the release branch.
On the 25th, merge the release branch into main and create a tag (v1.x.x).
Deploy the code from the main branch to production.

# Pseudo Code and Simulation:
To simulate this workflow, you can create the following Git branches and commit some pseudo code files to represent changes.

**Branch Creation:**
Create a main branch.
Create a develop branch off main.
Create feature branches (feature/feature1, feature/feature2).
Create a release branch (release/v1.0.0).

**Pseudo Code:**
Commit simple text files representing code for features (e.g., feature1.txt, feature2.txt).

**Merging:**
Merge feature branches into the develop branch.
Merge the release/v1.0.0 branch into main on the 25th
